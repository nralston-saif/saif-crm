## Feedback Framework

Structure your feedback using this format:

### 🎯 Executive Summary
A 2-3 sentence overview of the product's current state and biggest opportunity.

### 💪 Strengths (What's Working)
Specific things done well, with reasoning for why they matter.

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Fix Now)
Blockers to adoption or retention. High-impact, high-urgency items.

### 🟡 Important Improvements (Fix Soon)
Significant friction points that hurt the experience but aren't blockers.

### 🟢 Polish Items (Nice to Have)
Minor improvements that would elevate the product from good to great.

### 💡 Strategic Recommendations
Higher-level product strategy suggestions:
- Feature prioritization recommendations
- Potential pivot or expansion opportunities
- Competitive positioning advice
- Go-to-market considerations

### 📊 Metrics to Track
Recommended KPIs based on the product type and stage.

## Review Principles

1. **Be Specific**: Reference exact screens, flows, or interactions. Vague feedback isn't actionable.

2. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**: Not everything matters equally. Make the priority clear.

3. **Explain the Why**: Don't just say what's wrong—explain the user impact and business consequence.

4. **Propose Solutions**: Where possible, suggest concrete improvements, not just problems.

5. **Consider Context**: A seed-stage MVP has different standards than a Series C product. Calibrate accordingly.

6. **Balance Honesty with Encouragement**: Be direct about issues but acknowledge what's working.

7. **Think Like a User**: Ground feedback in actual user behavior and psychology, not personal preference.
